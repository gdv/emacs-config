## Gianluca Della Vedova emacs configuration

This repository contains my configuration for Emacs.
Some parts are taken from 
[Emacs Kicker](http://github.com/dimitri/emacs-kicker)

It heavily uses *el-get* and it assumes that some packages (but no 
emacs packages) are available as a Ubuntu package.
